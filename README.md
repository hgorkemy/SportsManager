A turn-based sports management game built with Java 21 and JavaFX 21. Manage a football or handball team through a full league season — set tactics, pick your lineup, simulate matches period by period, train your squad, and track standings.

## Design Patterns

| Pattern | Where | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Singleton | `GameSession` | One object holds all active game state; every controller reads from it |
| Abstract class | `Person`, `Player`, `Coach`, `Team` | Shared logic written once, reused by both sport subclasses |
| Factory | `SportFactory` / `SportRegistry` | Creates sport-specific objects without the caller knowing which sport is active |
| Template Method | `Coach.conductTraining()` | The training flow is fixed; only the attribute bonuses differ per sport |
| Strategy | `Tactic` | Each formation carries its own attack and defense multipliers |

## Screens

| Screen | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Splash | Animated intro; skip by clicking |
| Sport Selection | Choose Football or Handball; start a new game or load a save |
| Team Selection | Pick your team from the full roster list |
| Dashboard | Central hub — shows season, league position, next fixture; links to all other screens |
| Squad | Full squad list with OVR, goals, yellow/red cards, appearances, injury/suspension status |
| Tactics | Choose a formation and view the pitch diagram |
| Lineup | Select your starting lineup; invalid selections are rejected |
| Match | Period-by-period simulation with a live event log and half-time tactics change |
| Schedule | Full fixture list; played matches show scores; your rows are highlighted |
| League Table | Live standings with P/W/D/L/GF/GA/GD/Pts |
| Training | Weekly training programs; coach speciality gives a 1.5x bonus |
| End of Season | Final standings, player OVR changes, option to start a new season |
| Saves | List, load, or delete saved games |
